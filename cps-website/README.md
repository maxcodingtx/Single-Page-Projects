## About the Project
This project is a lightweight static website created by using HTML CSS and JS. Around the time I started this project (June 2024) I didn't have much experience in JavaScript. Therefore, I decided to create a website where I mainly focused on JavaScript web-interactivity.


## Features
* Current Features:
  * Simple & Responsive design
  * Simple HTML
  * Simple CSS styles
  * Simple Color Scheme


## Future plans
This project currently has code which I redeem as not optimized. Such code is found in the CSS and JS files. Therefore, I plan on revisiting the scripting and styling aspects of this website to optimized and clean the code.
