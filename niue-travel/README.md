# Niue travel

a mock tourist travel guide website for the country Niue

Demo can be viewed here: https://visit-niue.netlify.app/

## About The Project
This project is a lightweight static website created by using HTML CSS and JS. This was the first time I experimented with audio in web development.

## Future plans
This project currently has code which I redeem as not optimized. Such code is found in the HTML and CSS file. Therefore, I plan on revisiting the scripting and styling aspects of this website to optimized and clean the code.
I also plan to add a slideshow showcasing Niue, this will require HTML, CSS, and JS.
