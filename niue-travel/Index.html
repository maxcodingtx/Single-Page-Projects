            <p>
                Have you ever wanted to see natural beauty without 
                <br>
                having to deal with the ruckus that comes from heavy tourism?

                <br><br>
                Well then Niue is the place for you!
                <br><br>

                Niue is host to some of the cleanest coral beaches which
                all host vibrant and visible marine life.

                <br>

                Niue is also host to beautiful shallow caverns in which sunlight
                travels through.

                <br><br>

                All of this with a population of just 1500!
