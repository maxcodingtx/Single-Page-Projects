# Iphone Cart

At the time of making this, I did not have much experience in JavaScript. With that in mind, I decided to challenge myself to implement JavaScript into a front-end project.
The live demo can be found [here](https://maxcodingtx-iphone-cart.netlify.app/).

## About the Project

This project is a lightweight static website created by using HTML CSS and JS. I challenged myself to implement JavaScript into a from-end project.
