# Soccer Squad

This is another project of mine where I challenged myself to implement JavaScript into a project. This time I decided to manipulate scrolling positions and implicitly coerce strings into numbers. The live demo can be found [here](https://maxcodingtx-soccer-squad.netlify.app/)


## About the project 

This project is a lightweight static website created by using HTML CSS and JS. I challenged myself to implement JavaScript concepts new to me into a from-end project.
