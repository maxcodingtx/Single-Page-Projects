# Flexbox-guide

When I first began learning CSS I had trouble remembering the basics of flexbox. This included the flex-direction, align-items, justify-content, align-content properties.
In order to help myself remember these properties and what they did I challenged myself to build a website that shows exactly that.

## Future plans
This project currently has code which I see as not optimized. Such code is found in the CSS and JS files. Therefore, I plan on revisiting the scripting and styling aspects of this website to optimized and clean the code.
